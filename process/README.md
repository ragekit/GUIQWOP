Oh no I forgot to write a process diary for the first day of work. So now it is time to catch up.

This first 10h week is focused around fast prototype of a "GUI QWOP" so an interface that is unintuitive and hard to use.

The main idea is to use the same concept as QWOP and divide a simple action : make tea, into sub actions and design a difficult to use GUI widget for all of them.

I first started to make a very quick list of all the atomic widgets I could use (pressed button, circular slider, linear slider and the like), and made a mockup of all the actions needed to brew the tea, with some ideas on how to make a widget for each.

I started prototyping them and after 5h I have a first idea "mis en scene" and I had it tested by Enric. It works pretty well but I think it is still too easy. Though I think complications will be added once several new widgets are introduced. 

I allready changed slighly one module to make it slighly more complicated and it seems to be more interesting.

Enric suggested that I could add feedback or things to use simultaneously that are NOT nearby each others. I will test that next.

Onwards !
