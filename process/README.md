I tested today with Pippin and he did not go past the first add water module. It is interesting to note that changing its difficulty dramatically was just a matter of changing a boolean operator in the code. 

I think this is a proof that there is a "design by doing" that is often overlooked by more standard academic practices. 

Maybe I'm the one at fault here, but I often try to overdesign, and intelectualize how a design will behave. And once it is locked in my head, then I implement it. 

Of course this fails because I can not anticipate, however hard I try, what will happen when someone play my games. Evenmore, why would I design it if answers were known beforehand ? And usually, I lack the time to do proper playtest and my game get frozen in that state, that has potential, but poor realizations.

But once you've got a prototype going, it is easy to change a couple variable there and there, and this can drastically change the experience of your game. I'm slowly learning that going for a fast bad but playable version, even if your concept is still blurry in your head, and then working from there, is the best way to do research creation.

In term of process, for The Method, I'm wondering if it would not be better to use the built in github-pages. It uses markdown, so it would be the same workflow, but in a more " user friendly " readable way.

Also It might be interesting to tag certain commit, when a playable version is done, so they can be fetched easily and a collection of "progression prototypes" can be played. Maybe as part of the github-pages website ?

Oh no I forgot to write a process diary for the first day of work. So now it is time to catch up.

This first 10h week is focused around fast prototype of a "GUI QWOP" so an interface that is unintuitive and hard to use.

The main idea is to use the same concept as QWOP and divide a simple action : make tea, into sub actions and design a difficult to use GUI widget for all of them.

I first started to make a very quick list of all the atomic widgets I could use (pressed button, circular slider, linear slider and the like), and made a mockup of all the actions needed to brew the tea, with some ideas on how to make a widget for each.

I started prototyping them and after 5h I have a first idea "mis en scene" and I had it tested by Enric. It works pretty well but I think it is still too easy. Though I think complications will be added once several new widgets are introduced. 

I allready changed slighly one module to make it slighly more complicated and it seems to be more interesting.

Enric suggested that I could add feedback or things to use simultaneously that are NOT nearby each others. I will test that next.

Onwards !
